#### Video Demo:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8Y4eCfyjts

#### Description
**FilterMe** is a webpage, built with good old HTML / CSS / JS. What it does is actually pretty simple.
It is a client side image processing tool that enables the user to apply a filter on an image that the user has selected.

The tool supports the following features:

- Select an image (PNG / JPEG)
- Preview/Display of the original user given image
- Preview/Display of the final processed image
- The filters that can be applied include:
  - Duplicate / Copy
  - Grayscale
  - Sepia
  - Reflect

The project uses:

- File and FileReader
- Bas64 data encoding/decoding protocol
- sessionStorage object
- Low level canvas HTML/Web API
- The `img` tag via `Image` object

It uses a modular JS architecture (ES6 modules) and classes for maximal separation of concerns and re-usability reasons.
Essentially via this project a small JS image processing framework is created!

This tool is created for the final project of Harvard CS50 course :-)
